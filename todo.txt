Maybe an ellipse tool

assign names to each frame (e.g. brush, line, rotate)

Consider porting to SDL2 + Dear Imgui + Bgfx in the distant future
Assess the benfits
Overall performance will definitely improve but I will have to rewrite a
lot of code
I would have been better off choosing this trio at the beginning of the project

@Paolo-Oliverio Suggested I look into choosing a color palette

Have a look at Pro Motion NG

A builtin calculator?
  just a text box and a label (below the palette maybe)
  can sometimes be useful
  is it really necessary?
  how often will it be used?
  if you find yourself needing to use a calculator then
    maybe there is a feature missing

image, view, sampler
vulkan textures

transform a layer or transform a frame

set cursor and respond to clicks more precisely
  setMask could help

Have a look at qtbase/examples/widgets/mainwindows/sdi
There's a lot to learn

Should probably be calling update() instead of repaint() in most places
Should probably be using mouse release instead of mouse press in some places

Cell images that aren't a fixed size
  they grow as you draw on them
  they can be translated outside of the viewport and then back
  allows importing images that aren't the same size as the viewport
  tools will calculate a bounding rect to resize the image as needed
  the canvas could be resized without discarding anything
  flood fill just fills the viewport
  should we distinguish between empty and null?
    perhaps empty should mean null

Palette import and export
  export as png
  does the palette need to have a size?

remove layer button appears when hovering layer name
  would this be more intuitive than a button that removes the current layer?

there might be a few random constants that should be in config.hpp but aren't

should I make a post to r/gamedev?
  they might be interested in this
  could be a good place to get feedback

use the status bar for more than just tools
  it could make sense to use it for the color picker
  at the moment it seems underappreciated

differentiate between indexed with full alpha and indexed with transparent entry
  if there is a single fully transparent entry then it will be possible to
  composite indexed images into indexed images

optimize the palette carefully
  if we only export part of the palette we must make sure that there aren't any
  indicies in the image that are out of range
  we could determine the maximum index in the image and export all entries up to
  that index
  we could provide a button that optimizes the palette

Could be useful

create polymorphic surface in graphics library
  gfx::Image perhaps
  add visit function for converting to gfx::Surface
  should it store Format? how?
