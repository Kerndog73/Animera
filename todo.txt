Consider porting to SDL2 + Dear Imgui + Bgfx in the distant future
Assess the benfits
Overall performance will definitely improve but I will have to rewrite a
lot of code
I would have been better off choosing this trio at the beginning of the project

@Paolo-Oliverio Suggested I look into choosing a color palette

image, view, sampler
vulkan textures

Have a look at Pro Motion NG

UTI
  there doesn't seem to be a good reason to declare a custom UTI
  just use the dynamically generated one

  function decode(input) {
    const key = "abcdefghkmnpqrstuvwxyz0123456789"
    const char2binary = char => key.indexOf(char).toString(2).padStart(5, "0");
    const binary = Array.prototype.map.call(input, char2binary).join("");
    const bytes = binary.match(/.{1,8}/g).map(str => parseInt(str, 2));
    return bytes.map(byte => String.fromCharCode(byte)).join("");
  }
  
  run mdls to get UTI of file

should I make a post to r/gamedev?
  they might be interested in this
  could be a good place to get feedback

--------------------------------- optimizations --------------------------------

optimize LayerCells
  we need stable pointers to Cells
  std::deque keeps pointers stable if you insert or erase from either end
  are these guarantees enough?
    how about using std::vector and emitting currCellChanged more often?
  in Timeline
    in a lot of places, we call changePos even through the position isn't changing
    this is because the address of the cell is changing
    changing the way the currCellChanged signal is emitted could break things

filled polygon
  polygon to triangles (ear something)
  even-odd fill rule
  fill triangles
  scanline algorithm for filling polygons

fixed byte order image formats

  measure the speed increase

are there resources than can be shared between windows?
  global resource cache might be useful

more efficient status message updates
  there might be situations where the status bar is updated multiple times and
  only the last update is seen

----------------------------------- scripting ----------------------------------

scripting interface
  command-line interface
  in-app scripting interface maybe
  interactive command prompt accessible from ui perhaps
  what are the potential use cases for this?
    automatic export
    bulk operations
    
transform a layer or transform a frame
  would it make sense to extend this concept to all tools?
  bulk operations?
  apply the actions of a tool on multiple cells

editor scaling is sometimes a pixel off
  this might be due to QPainter using floats
  might have to do scaling myself

----------------------------------- palette ------------------------------------

differentiate between indexed with full alpha and indexed with transparent entry
  if there is a single fully transparent entry then it will be possible to
  composite indexed images into indexed images

optimize the palette carefully
  if we only export part of the palette we must make sure that there aren't any
  indicies in the image that are out of range
  we could determine the maximum index in the image and export all entries up to
  that index
  we could provide a button that optimizes the palette

palette index out of range
  we currently get an error from libpng
  need to handle this properly
  maybe the palette should be resizable?
    this would make it possible to export a small palette while preventing out
    of range indicies
  
palette manipulation
  reordering the palette could be useful
  inserting or removing transparent blank from the start is especially useful
  
compositing index images is broken
  it kind of gets weird if index 0 doesn't correspond to the color 0
  i'm not really sure what the "correct" behaviour is

generate a palette from a gradient

---------------------------------- features ------------------------------------

make exporting less tedious
  store paths in QSettings
  assign names to each frame
  would it be useful to copy export settings to and from the clipboard?
  should export settings be kept in the sprite file?
    probably shouldn't store the directory
  button to export the settings stored in the file (Quick Export)

proper undo/redo system
  an application-wide undo system would be cool
  
A builtin calculator?
  just a text box and a label (below the palette maybe)
  can sometimes be useful
  is it really necessary?
  how often will it be used?
  if you find yourself needing to use a calculator then
    maybe there is a feature missing

use the status bar for more than just tools
  it could make sense to use it for the color picker
  at the moment it seems underappreciated

behave like a proper Single Document Interface (SDI) application
  qtbase/examples/widgets/mainwindows/sdi

quicklook plugin

  https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/Quicklook_Programming_Guide/Introduction/Introduction.html

--------------------------------- refactoring ----------------------------------

more abstract tool interface
  use QImage::cacheKey to avoid emitChanges
  states, state transitions and state updates
    can all tools fit into this restricted model?
  mouseLeave event handlers seem to all be the same
  something similar to DragPaintTool but for all tools

remove signals from tools (maybe?)
  tools update a data structure
  another system reads data structure and sends signals
  not sure if this is a real improvement
  probably ties in with making a more abstract tool interface

------------------------------------- tools ------------------------------------

gradient tool
  radial gradient?
  bayer matrix?
  
scale tool
  it's possible now that we have dynamically resizable cells
  we could also allow the user to resize the canvas
  
Maybe an ellipse tool

---------------------------------- minor bugs ----------------------------------

what's up the the height of the timeline?
  reduce to min then go fullscreen
  
set cursor and respond to clicks more precisely
  setMask could help
  https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qwidget.html#setMask

editor cursor update issues
  it seems like the cursor will only update after a mouseMove event
  cursor doesn't update when
    zooming out of editor and mouse leaves
    mouse enters editor while dragging

panels can be nested
  download file in chrome then CMD+SHIFT+G
  what's up with the file dialog in export dialog?

growCell overflows
  could overflow cell pos
  could exceed max image size
  check for other places where this could be a problem

" - edited" in the window title
  https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-79677

-------------------------------- minor features --------------------------------

would the user ever want to automatically adjust the scale of the editor?

remove layer button appears when hovering layer name
  would this be more intuitive than a button that removes the current layer?

A CRC error is a lot more informative than "animation delay is out-of-range"
  if possible, check the CRC before checking the content itself

------------------------------- minor refactoring ------------------------------

there might be a few random constants that should be in config.hpp but aren't

Should probably be calling update() instead of repaint() in most places

Should probably be using mouse release instead of mouse press in some places
