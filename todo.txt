Maybe an ellipse tool

assign names to each frame (e.g. brush, line, rotate)

Consider porting to SDL2 + Dear Imgui + Bgfx in the distant future
Assess the benfits
Overall performance will definitely improve but I will have to rewrite a
lot of code
I would have been better off choosing this trio at the beginning of the project

@Paolo-Oliverio Suggested I look into choosing a color palette

Have a look at Pro Motion NG

A builtin calculator?
  just a text box and a label (below the palette maybe)
  can sometimes be useful
  is it really necessary?
  how often will it be used?
  if you find yourself needing to use a calculator then
    maybe there is a feature missing

image, view, sampler
vulkan textures

transform a layer or transform a frame
  would it make sense to extend this concept to all tools?
  bulk operations?
  apply the actions of a tool on multiple cells

set cursor and respond to clicks more precisely
  setMask could help
  https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qwidget.html#setMask

Have a look at qtbase/examples/widgets/mainwindows/sdi
There's a lot to learn

Should probably be calling update() instead of repaint() in most places
Should probably be using mouse release instead of mouse press in some places

Palette import and export
  export as png
  does the palette need to have a size?

remove layer button appears when hovering layer name
  would this be more intuitive than a button that removes the current layer?

there might be a few random constants that should be in config.hpp but aren't

should I make a post to r/gamedev?
  they might be interested in this
  could be a good place to get feedback

use the status bar for more than just tools
  it could make sense to use it for the color picker
  at the moment it seems underappreciated

differentiate between indexed with full alpha and indexed with transparent entry
  if there is a single fully transparent entry then it will be possible to
  composite indexed images into indexed images

optimize the palette carefully
  if we only export part of the palette we must make sure that there aren't any
  indicies in the image that are out of range
  we could determine the maximum index in the image and export all entries up to
  that index
  we could provide a button that optimizes the palette

generate a palette from a gradient

filled polygon
  polygon to triangles (ear something)
  even-odd fill rule
  fill triangles
  scanline algorithm for filling polygons

scale tool
  it's possible now that we have dynamically resizable cells
  we could also allow the user to resize the canvas

proper undo/redo system
  an application-wide undo system would be cool

using the offset property of QImage could be a mistake
  Cells should have positions
  images should not
  if we're dealing with an image that has a position,
    we're actually dealing with a cell but it looks like an image
  perhaps using isNull() directly on an image is a mistake too?

wand select tool should use the flood fill bounds to improve efficiency
