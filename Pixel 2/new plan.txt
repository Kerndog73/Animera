An Image is a pixmap with a transform
  has a translation
  has a scale
  has a rotation
  has a image handle

A Cell is an item on the timeline
  has a position which is the layer and the frame
  When a cell is added or removed from a layer
    All of the cells in that layer are informed
      This allows Duplicate and Transform cells to update their reference to
      the SourceCell
  SourceCell
    Stores an image that can be manipulated
    Image is either a color RGBA image or a paletted image
  DuplicateCell
    Duplicate the previous cell
    When the previous cell is a null cell
      produces a null image
  TransformCell
    Transform the previous cell
    The stored transformation is absolute
      The image from the SourceCell is taken and its transform is replaced with
      the stored transform
    When the previous cell is a null cell
      produces a null image

A Layer is a horizontal array of Cells
A Frame is a vertical stack of Cells
An Animation is a sequence of Layers
  has a size
  all cells have the same size as the animation
  all cells are either paletted or colored
  there is one palette for the whole animation

Timeline
  When creating a new frame, user can append either
    a blank SourceCell
    a DuplicateCell
    a TransformCell
      stored transform is initialized with the transform of the SourceCell
  When the user tries to use a tool on a null cell,
    a SourceCell is created
  When the user tries to use a tool on a DuplicateCell,
    it will be converted to a SourceCell
  When the user tries to use a tool on a TransformCell,
    a message will tell the user that this is not allowed
  Layers can be hidden
    This prevents them from being seen in the render window
    Toggled by pressing H
  Layers can be isolated
    This hiding all layers apart from this one
    Toggled by pressing I
  Onion skin mode
    Renders the previous cell behind the current cell with a reduced opacity
    Toggled by pression O
  WASD to change the current cell
  Animation can be played
    user can set a frame delay
    animation is looped
    can pause and play by pressing space

Transformations
  User can apply relative transformations to a SourceCell or a TransformCell
  Translations and scales are integers
  Rotation is always a multiple of 90 degrees
  Origin of rotation is always the center of the image
  Order
    Rotation
    Scale
    Translation
  User can select the transformation they want to apply and use the arrow keys
    For translation or scale
      UP     -y
      RIGHT  +x
      DOWN   +y
      LEFT   -x
    For rotation
      UP     CW
      RIGHT  CW
      DOWN   CCW
      LEFT   CCW
    Scaling up and down adds and subtracts from the absolute scale of the image
      this may be slightly unintuitive but provides more flexibility

Palette Mode
  There are 256 colors in the palette
  Clicking on a color will attach that color to the color picker
  Clicking on the tool color will set it to the index of the color in the
    color picker
  Pressing z, x, c on a palette color will set tool color

RGBA Mode
  Clicking on a color in the default palette will set the color picker to that color
    this does not attach the color
    this sets the color of the attached ColorHandle to the color in the palette
  Clicking on the tool color will attach that color to the color picker

ColorHandle
  a handle to a color
  used for attaching colors to the color picker
  keeps track of where the color came from so that a string name can be generated
  always refers to an RGBA color

ColorPicker
  indicates the source of the color that is currently attached
    "Palette 14" or "Secondary"
  HSV color picker with alpha slider and text boxes for RGBA and HSV

Export
  The current frame can be exported as a PNG
  The animation can be exported as a sequence of PNGs
    User can select a directory to fill with the PNGs
    User can provide a name for the PNGs
    Each PNG will have the frame number
    Conflicting files will be overwritten
  The current palette can be exported as a px2pal

Import
  PNGs can be imported
    this replaces the current cell with SourceCell (if it isn't one already)
    then sets the contents of the SourceCell to the image
    If the PNG is too big
      it will be cropped
    if the PNG is too small
      the remaining space will be filled with transparent black
  A palette can be imported from a px2pal to replace the current palette

Status Bar
  Appears as a line of text in the bottom left corner
  When mouse is in editor
    mouse position
    color and palette index if this is a palette animation
  When using rectangular selection tool
    Not selected
      same as mouse in editor
    Selecting or Selected
      start and end position
      size of selection
  When hovering over palette tile
    palette mode
      palette index
      color
    rgba mode
      color name
      color
  Temporary messages may appear for a few seconds
    When the CMD+S is pressed, "Saved!" will appear for a few seconds
    temporary messages overwrite messages coming from things like the editor
    temporary messages are removed after 5 seconds
    if a temporary message arrives while a temporary message is being shown
      the old message is replaced with a new one
    this might work better than having a static status bar
      if the user presses CMD+S but then moves the mouse in the editor,
        they might missed the "Saved!" message and think that the animation
        has not been saved

Tool options
  Appears as a line in the bottom right corner
  Shows options for configuring the selected tool
  Setting the size of the brush or axes of symmetry or the thinkness of a line

RGBAToolColors
  Stores RGBA colors for tool colors

PaletteToolColors
  Stores palette indicies for tool colors
  Stores a handle to the palette of the animation

ToolColors
  either an RGBAToolColors object or PaletteToolColors object
  has virtual functions for setting the pen and brush colors

A Tool responds to mouse inputs and manipulates Images
  accepts primary/secondary/erase down/move/up events
    event includes a Cell that can be modified
    and ToolColors
  an overlay image may be requested from the current tool
    an overlay image is a grayscale, partially transparent image
    an overlay image is rendered on the editor
  the paint tools use the primary/secondary/erase colors to paint the image
  paint tools use the Source composite operation so they can erase
  BrushTool
    sets a circle of pixels
    user can set the size
    overlay shows brush shape
    mouse down paints the brush
    mouse move paints a line between the previous point and the current point
    mouse up points a line between the previous point and the current point
    there is no buffering like the other paint tools
    changes are made live
  LineTool
    user can set thickness
    mouse down sets the start point
    mouse up sets the end point
  FilledCircleTool
    user can decide between a 1x1, 1x2, 2x1, 2x2 center
    mouse down sets the center
    mouse up sets the radius
  FilledRectangleTool
    mouse down sets a corner
    mouse up sets an opposite corner
  StrokedCircleTool
    user can set thickness
    user can decide between a 1x1, 1x2, 2x1, 2x2 center
    mouse down sets the center
    mouse up sets the radius
  StrokedRectangleTool
    user can set thickness
    mouse down sets a corner
    mouse up sets an opposite corner
  FloodFillTool
    mouse down will flood fill all surrounding pixels of the same color
  RectangleSelectTool
    primary down sets a corner
    primary up sets an opposite corner and copies the selection
    if the tool is holding a copied selection and the mouse is not down,
      sets the overlay to the lumosity of the selection
    if primary is down
      sets the overlay to a rectangle showing the selection
    secondary down pastes the copied selection
      does nothing if no selection has been copied
    erase down
      erases the rectangle of the selection at the mouse position
      not at the original selection position
  MaskSelectTool
    primary down sets the start position
    primary move appends a point to a polygon if that point is not at the end
    primary up appends the current point and the start point
      a mask is created by filling the polygon
      the mask is used to copy part of the image
    shows overlay like rectangle select
    secondary down pastes the copied selection
      does nothing if no selection has been copied
      uses the Source composite operation for pixels within the mask
      does not change pixels outside of the mask
    erase down
      erases the shape of the selection at the mouse position
  SymmetryTool
    similar to BrushTool
    user can set the size of the brush
    user can set the symmetry mode
      vertical
      horizontal
      vertial and horizontal
    overlay shows brush shape on all sides of symmetry
    mouse events are the same as BrushTool except that multiple points are painted
  transformation tools can be applied to both SourceCells and TransformCells
  MoveTool
    arrow keys may be used to move
    translation is shown in the status bar
    dragging can also be used to move
  ScaleTool
    arrow keys may be used to scale
    scale is shown in the status bar
    dragging can not be used to scale
  RotateTool
    arrow keys may be used to rotate
    rotation angle is shown in the status bar
    dragging can not be used to rotate

Tools
  Stores all of the tools and pointer to the active tool
  responsible for switching tools and routing messages to the current tool
  passes the current cell to the current tool

Project management
  If the application is launched by opening an animation file,
    that animation file will be opened
  If the application is launched without a animation file
    the user will be presented with the New Animation window
  The user will be asked "Do You Want To Save?" before the current animation
  is changed
  Clicking the "New Animation" button will show the New Animation window
    User can set the size of the animation and whether they want to use a palette
  Clicking the "Open Animation" button will show the FileDialog for opening animations
  Clicking the "Save Animation" button
    if the current animation was opened from a file
      that file will be updated
    if the current animation was previously saved to a file
      that file will be updated
    if the current animation has not been saved before
      a FileDialog for saving animations will be shown

Undo
  a stack of images of the current SourceCell are stored
  or a stack of transforms of the current TransformCell
  a pointer to the top image is stored
    there is always at least one image in the stack
    probably want to implement this as an index if the stack is dynamically
    changing size
  when the current SourceCell is changed
    the stack is cleared
    the state of the new SourceCell is pushed onto the stack
    the pointer is set the pushed item
  when a tool updates the current SourceCell
    if there are images after the pointer
      they will be removed
      the new image will be pushed after the pointer
    the modified image is pushed to the stack
    the pointer is incremented to pointer to the image that was pushed
    if the stack size is greater than 64
      the oldest items are removed
  when the undo button is pressed
    if the stack is empty (this is not a SourceCell)
      a temporary message will show "Cannot undo actions on this cell"
    if the current pointer is pointing to the base of the stack
      a temporary message will show "Cannot undo any further"
    otherwise
      the pointer is decremented
      the current source cell will be updated with the pointed image
  when the redo button is pressed
    if the stack is empty (this is not a SourceCell)
      a temporary message will show "Cannot redo actions on this cell"
    if the current pointer is pointing to the top of the stack
      a temporary message will show "Cannot redo any further"
    otherwise
      the pointer is incremented
      the current source cell will be updated with the pointed image
